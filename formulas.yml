List of all equations:
1) Net Force: Fn = i sum, j sum
2) Net Force with Theta: Fn = i cos theta sum, j sin theta sum
3) Normal Force: fn = mg
4) Normal Force Components: Fn = mg (cos or sin) theta
5) Magnitude of Force: F = ma
6) Magnitude of Tension: T = mg sin theta
7) Static Friction (to keep object at equilibrium): Fs = mu s N
8) Kinetic Friction (to keep object moving): Fk = mu k N
9) Minimum Force to Start Moving Object: F = mu s N
10) Spring Constant (at rest): k = F / x
11) Spring Extension/Extended Length: x = F / k
12) Angle that Object Will Slide Down Incline Plane: theta = tan inverse (h / l)
13) Pulley Spring Constant: k = F / x
14) Pulley Spring Extension: x = F / k
15) Pulley Rope Tension: T = F / x
