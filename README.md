# PHY2048 - Physics Calculator
### Current Version: v1
### Version Roadmap:
_Version 1: Base functionality of all PHY2048 learning modules_
_Version 2: Able to explain process of solving all learning modules_
_Version 3: Undetermined_

## Class Information
**Instructor:** Zhongzhou Chen

**University:** University of Central Florida

**Semester Taken:** Fall 2022
 
## Calculator Initialization:
To start up the calculator, use the following command line prompt to initialize the program in the directory you assigned the repository upon cloning:

_($python3 initialPyton.py)_

After startup, follow the prompts for the calculator to determine the best methods to solve for your problem. If your problem isn't listed or isn't solveable, please see the ["Questions or Suggestions"](##-Questions-or-Suggestions) section of this README.md file.

## Purpose:
The purpose of this repository is to showcase assignments to employers that I (Joshua Lim) have completed in structed, graded, and criteria based environments while I learn various languages along my education (in this case, the 'Python' language), as well as to showcase my understanding of git and allow time for me to focus on bigger projects (such as the social media platform my company, Creating Real LLC, is currently developing) without requiring time and energy on smaller projects that would serve the same purpose as classwork. The program for this repository is also helping me (Joshua Lim) learn how physics equations work, the method of solving certain problems presented in class, and (in v2) has the program present each step in the process of getting the correct solution for studying and educational intentions.
