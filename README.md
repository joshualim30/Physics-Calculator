## Purpose:
The purpose of this repository is to showcase assignments to employers that I (Joshua Lim) have completed in structed, graded, and criteria based environments while I learn various languages along my education (in this case, the 'C' language), as well as to showcase my understanding of git and allow time for me to focus on bigger projects (such as the social media platform my company, Creating Real LLC, is currently developing) without requiring time and energy on smaller projects that would serve the same purpose as classwork.
